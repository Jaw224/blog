					<h3> About Our Trip </h3>
					<p align = "justify"><font size = "+1" color = "black" face = "garamond"><br>During the summer of 2017 I was paying for rent in Pittsburgh while spending any time I wasn’t working outside. I would come home to sleep, eat, and pack up for my next adventure. The financial burden of having an apartment didn’t seem worth the return. Every weekend I would find myself as far from Pittsburgh as possible, reaping no benefit from a stationary home. </font></p>
					<p align = "justify"><font size = "+1" color = "black" face = "garamond">When Zoe and I were devising post-graduation plans the last thing I wanted to do was spend the summer tied down geographically and financially. The prospect of living out of a mini-van offered us the freedom to make everyday an adventure. Stripping our lives down to the bare essentials allows us to live more efficiently, mindfully, and most importantly, free. </font></p>
					<p align = "justify"><font size = "+1" color = "black" face = "garamond">We hope to use this freedom to explore parts of the country in ways that would be otherwise unimaginable. Our time in Pittsburgh was enhanced by great access to public parks, easy public and bike transportation routes, and a vibrant community of passionate and engaged citizens. As we venture to our next city we want to make sure to keep an eye out for elements of a city that we have identified as being vital to our enjoyment of city life. These urban escapes provide reprieve from the go, go, go of the city vibe and remind us to slow down and focus on the small things.</font></p>

						<p><br>Q: Why are you choosing to drive around living a in a van after you just graduated college?</p>

				</div> 
				<div class = "row">
                    <font size = "+1" align = "justify" color = "black" face = "garamond">
                    	<p>A: While we were considering what to do after we graduated we realized we could look for jobs in Pittsburgh (where we went to college), in Philly (our home), or we could look for jobs anywhere else. We decided we would prefer to spend some time, effort and money looking for the a new place to live and work for the next few years rather than stay somewhere we have already been. We are both adventure seekers and nature fanatics so this lifestyle already attracted us. We also realized that we are in a unique time in our lives where we now have a newfound amount of freedom, and the ability to choose where we want to go next. We are seizing this and using it to our advantage as much as possible. We are using the grace period of our loans, which is about 6 months, to explore the country and settle on a new place we are passionate about to invest our time and energy into a new job. </p>
